# Cancer Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds a **Cancer Prediction Model** using **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** to estimate the probability of cancer based on various features. The goal is to analyze how different regression techniques perform in predicting cancer likelihood.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Processing** â€“ Handling missing values and normalizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Understanding data distribution and feature relationships.
- **Feature Engineering** â€“ Selecting and transforming relevant features.
- **Model Implementation** â€“ Using **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression**.
- **Model Evaluation** â€“ Comparing performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cancer-Prediction-Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Cancer-Prediction-Model
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the model:
   ```sh
   python model.py
   ```

## Results
- **Linear Regression** provides a basic trend analysis but has limitations in capturing complex relationships.
- **Polynomial Regression** performs better by adapting to nonlinear patterns in the data, improving accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how regression techniques can be applied to **medical predictions**. Polynomial Regression shows better results, making it a valuable approach for cancer probability estimation.
